MIM_DATA message
The MIM_DATA message is sent to a MIDI input callback function when a MIDI message is received by a MIDI input device.
C++


MIM_DATA 
dwParam1 = dwMidiMessage 
dwParam2 = dwTimestamp 


Parameters

dwMidiMessage
MIDI message that was received. The message is packed into a doubleword value as follows:
High word	High-order byte	Not used.
Low-order byte	Contains a second byte of MIDI data (when needed).
Low word	High-order byte	Contains the first byte of MIDI data (when needed).
Low-order byte	Contains the MIDI status.
 
The two MIDI data bytes are optional, depending on the MIDI status byte.
dwTimestamp
Time that the message was received by the input device driver. The time stamp is specified in milliseconds, beginning at zero when the midiInStart function was called.
Return Value

This message does not return a value.
Remarks

MIDI messages received from a MIDI input port have running status disabled; each message is expanded to include the MIDI status byte.
This message is not sent when a MIDI system-exclusive message is received.
